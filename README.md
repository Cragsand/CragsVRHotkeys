A simple AutoHotkey script that forcefully terminates SteamVR and VRChat to restart the game as quickly as possible. 
- Useful if you crash/freeze 
- Also terminates EAC since that can freeze and get stuck running in the background
- Source code all in vrhotkeys.ahk so you can modify it using Notepad or any other text editor 

The executable is compiled with AutoHotkey built-in but you don't have to use it. Either run the script by itself or compile it yourself by right clicking the source .ahk file. Running .ahk scripts requires that you to install https://www.autohotkey.com
