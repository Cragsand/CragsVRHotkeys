A simple AutoHotkey script that forcefully terminates SteamVR and VRChat to restart the game and SteamVR as quickly as possible. 
- Useful when roleplaying if you crash/freeze to restart as quickly as possible
- Updated to include also terminating EAC since that can freeze and get stuck running in the background
- Source code included so you can modify it using Notepad or any other text editor 

You don't have to run the executable file. Either run the script directly or compile it yourself by right clicking the source .ahk file. 
Running the script directly requires https://www.autohotkey.com/
