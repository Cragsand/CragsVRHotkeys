A simple AutoHotkey script that forcefully terminates SteamVR, VRChat and restarts the game as quickly as possible. 
- Useful if you crash/freeze while roleplaying
- Also terminates EAC since that can freeze and get stuck running in the background
- Source code all in vrhotkeys.ahk so you can modify it using Notepad or any other text editor
